# Everest Mod CLI

**WIP**: This project is under development. Expect breaking changes and limited functionality. Use at your own risk.

A command-line interface tool for managing Celeste mods using the maddie480's public online database.

This project currently targets **Linux** installation. The **Flatpak** version is not supported. **MacOS** might work, but it's not guaranteed

## Installation

Make sure you have installed [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

Clone the repo and build it yourself using `cargo`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pinpinroku/everest-mod-cli.git
cd everest-mod-cli
cargo build --release
```

> If your CPU supports the **AVX2** feature, set the flag `RUSTFLAGS='-C target-feature=+avx2'` before building to accelerate hash calculation speed. You can check whether your CPU supports **AVX2** by running `lscpu | grep avx2`.

Then symlink the binary to the local bin directory.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin/
ln -s $HOME/everest-mod-cli/target/release/everest-mod-cli $HOME/.local/bin/everest-mod-cli
```

> We plan to release the built binary files once the specifications are finalized (stabilized).

## Option

You can specify your custom mods directory using `--mods-dir`.
```bash
# Install the mod "SpeedrunTool" while specifying the mods directory

```
> The directory should have permissions of at least 0700.

## Motivation

Everest and Olympus are excellent tools for managing Celeste mods. However, there are still some quality-of-life improvements that could be made:

- Olympus is unstable or completely non-functional on certain Linux distributions, particularly in **Wayland** environments.
- Download speed is slow in some countries.
  - CLI tools like `curl` or `wget` are sometimes faster than in-game downloads.
  - Cannot run auto updates on background.
  - Need to wait or entirely cancel the updates when opening the game.
- No option to *cancel*, *pause*, or *resume* downloads in mod menu.
- Lack of clarity about `dependencies` when uninstalling mods.

## Notes

- The `mod_name` and the corresponding filenames may not match.
- The `mod_name` refers to the name of the Mod as it appears in the game menu.
- The `filename` is the name of the zip file that contains the Mod's assets and the manifest file called `everest.yaml`.
